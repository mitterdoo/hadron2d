	Structure:
	All types of input (keyboard presses, mouse clicks/movements, gamepad buttons/sticks, etc.)
	are captured and sent to the `rawinput` event.
	A full list of allowed input names is shown below, but the naming convention is as follows:
		device.type_name
		All lowercase
	`device` may be:
		key
		mouse
		gamepad
	`type` may be:
		button
		axis
	*	vector
		event
	*Vector inputs will automatically be processed if there is an axis with the same name that
		also has "_x" and "_y" components, meaning the vector input shouldn't be manually fired.
		You may fire a vector input only if there isn't an axis of the same name that has x and y axes.
	
	`name` may be anything, though there is a special case when using the `axis` type:
		With the `axis` type, an optional "_x" and "_y" may be appended to the name.
		Internally, when either of the values change, an event of type vector with the same device and
		name will be fired, using the two components as the arguments.

	When any input changes, the input.rawinput event will be fired with:
		fullName		string		The full name of the input, following the naming convention above
		player			number		The index of the player who triggered this input on their gamepad, or -1 if it wasn't from a gamepad.
		...				vararg		The value(s) of this event, depending on input type:
			button:
				pressed		boolean
			axis:
				value		number
			vector:
				x			number
				y			number
			event:
				...			Values of event
		
	
	
	There are 4 players that may receive raw inputs.
	Each player has their own associated PlayerInput object.
	When rawinput events are fired, they will be passed down to either:
		All players, if the player argument is -1
		One player, whose ID matches the argument given
	
	Each PlayerInput contains a set of ActionMaps, which may be used as different
		input maps for different contexts, such as menus and in-game. Rawinput
		events will pass down to these ActionMaps if they are enabled.
	
	Next, an ActionMap may contain a list of Actions which can be listened to by
		your game. Bindings within these Actions will listen to the rawinput
		of the containing ActionMap and determine whether to update the Action.



	Input Paths:

		Gamepad (must set to other players manually)
			gamepad.button_north
			gamepad.button_east
			gamepad.button_south
			gamepad.button_west
			gamepad.button_dpad_up
			gamepad.button_dpad_right
			gamepad.button_dpad_down
			gamepad.button_dpad_left
			gamepad.axis_dpad_x		[-1.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.axis_dpad_y		[-1.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.vector_dpad		[-1.0, 1.0], [-1.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.button_lshoulder

			gamepad.vector_lstick	[-1.0, 1.0], [-1.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.button_lstick
			gamepad.button_ltrigger
			gamepad.axis_ltrigger	[0.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.button_rshoulder
			gamepad.button_rstick_up
			gamepad.button_rstick_right
			gamepad.button_rstick_down
			gamepad.button_rstick_left
			gamepad.axis_rstick_x	[-1.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.axis_rstick_y	[-1.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.vector_rstick	[-1.0, 1.0], [-1.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.button_rstick
			gamepad.button_rtrigger
			gamepad.axis_rtrigger	[0.0, 1.0]
			gamepad.button_back
			gamepad.button_start
			gamepad.button_guide

			gamepad.event_connect		gamepadIndex
			gamepad.event_disconnect	gamepadIndex

		Mouse:
								<no ranges for mouse axes>
			mouse.axis_delta_x
			mouse.axis_delta_y
			mouse.vector_delta

			mouse.button_1
			mouse.button_2
			mouse.button_3
			...

			mouse.axis_pos_x
			mouse.axis_pos_y
			mouse.vector_pos

			mouse.axis_scroll_x
			mouse.axis_scroll_y
			mouse.vector_scroll

		Keyboard:
			key.any

			... (KeyConstants as defined in LOVE)
		
	

	Listed above are valid names of Inputs.
	No deadzones or any other input modifications are applied to them. The data is raw.
	button_* and all key.* Inputs will be of type boolean
	axis_*_x and axis_*_y Inputs will be a number in the range depending on the type of Input
	vector_* Inputs will return two numbers, range also dependent on Input type

	Values of Inputs should be cached

	Bindings listen for certain Input events to be fired, and will fire different events depending on what happened to the input.
	Bindings can output either a boolean value (like a button), or an axis (1d or 2d), similar to Unity
	Each event will be given the current output value of the binding.
		[Event Name]	[Occurs when..]
		started			Input first changes from default state and "activates" (Button just now pressed down, or joystick moved center outside deadzone)
		changed			Input value changes and is still activated.
		stopped			Input value rests at default and "deactivates"
	A Binding must be given a controller to listen to, which means multiple instances of Bindings will need to be created to allow multiple controllers at once. 


	<Event RawInput>
		string		inputPath
		string		inputType	(keymouse|gamepad)
		number		player
		...			varargs

	[PlayerInput]
		An object that represents a single player.
		Contains a list of [ActionMap]s. Each [ActionMap] will have raw input piped into them.

	[ActionMap]
		A collection of [Action]s.
		May be enabled or disabled.
		Contains an [Event] that will pass down piped raw inputs.
		Will also broadcast enable/disable events, which should be used by [Action]s to deactivate their outputs
	
	[Action]
		An action that can be performed when certain inputs are performed.
		Expects raw inputs, to pass down to [Binding] descendants.
		Contains 3 events:
			[Event Name]	[Occurs when..]
			started			Input first changes from default state and "activates" (Button just now pressed down, or joystick moved center outside deadzone)
			changed			Input value changes and is still activated.
			stopped			Input value rests at default and "deactivates"
		These events may be fired by [Binding] descendants when they are activated.
		Output event type may be of:
			button		boolean
			value		number
			vector		2d axis; 2 numbers
			event		any args
	
	[Binding]
		Listens for raw inputs 


	There are 4 types of bindings:
	button
		Can be triggered by:
			button
			axis (when passing a certain threshold, positive/negative)
			
	axis
		Allows 1 axis input
		{
			"axis_inputName"
		}
		or
		{
			pos = "button_inputName",
			neg = "button_inputName"
		}
	vector
		Allows 2 axis inputs
		{
			""
		}
	event
		Allows only 1 input, but with varargs
